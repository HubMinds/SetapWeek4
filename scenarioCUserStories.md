###### Should there be options for multiple payment gateways?
Yes there should be multiple payment gateways but card should be the main payment option.

###### If I owe someone £10 but then they owe me £5, will the app automatically reduce how much I owe them to £5 and how much they owe me to £0?
<p>Not automatically but I would like to be given the option. E.g. a popup that asks whether I'd like to do that.</p>

###### If you owe someone money would you want that to be visible from their end aswell?
Yes, I believe it should be transparent and visible for all parties involved.
