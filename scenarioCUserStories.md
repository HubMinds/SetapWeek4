### Should there be options for multiple payment gateways?
Yes there should be multiple payment gateways but card should be the main payment option.

### If I owe someone £10 but then they owe me £5, will the app automatically reduce how much I owe them to £5 and how much they owe me to £0?
<p>Not automatically but I would like to be given the option. E.g. a popup that asks whether I'd like to do that.</p>

### If you owe someone money would you want that to be visible from their end aswell?
Yes, I believe it should be transparent and visible for all parties involved.

### If I owe someone £10 but then they owe me £5, will the app automatically reduce how much I owe them to £5 and how much they owe me to £0?
Not automatically but I would like to be given the option. E.g. a popup that asks whether I'd like to do that.

### Should payments be taken automatically?
Yes they should be taken at the start of the month for big bills like rent and power but for things like food for the week they should be paid for manually and if the cost of rent changes I should be notified.

### Should you just total the bill at the end of the month or run seperate expenses individully?
I would rather split big expenses at the start if the month and then add smaller expenses as they happen through the month

### When repairs are requried how would the system handle the bills?
<p>When something has broken the person who cause said incident should be able to initiate a bill split request to pay for the rapair, but the diffenrence between this and other bill splitting request is that this one should be opt in/out with each use choosing whether they bear the responsibility to pay for said repar and it will calculate the split price after everyone ha opted in or out</p>
