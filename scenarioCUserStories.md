###### Should there be options for multiple payment gateways?
Yes there should be multiple payment gateways but card should be the main payment option.

###### If I owe someone £10 but then they owe me £5, will the app automatically reduce how much I owe them to £5 and how much they owe me to £0?
<p>Not automatically but I would like to be given the option. E.g. a popup that asks whether I'd like to do that.</p>

### Should payments be taken automatically?
Yes they should be taken at the start of the month for big bills like rent and power but for things like food for the week they should be paid for manually and if the cost of rent changes I should be notified.
